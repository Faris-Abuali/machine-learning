# Question
"This method provides an unbiased estimate of model performance by isolating the model selection process (hyperparameter tuning) from the evaluation process."

What still confuses me is where is the validation set in this?
I mean they say this way we separate the data into: train, validation, and test datasets.
But what I find confusing is in GridSearch.fit() after we find the best params, we do

```py
Instantiate the classifier with the best parameters ðŸ’ª
        self.clf = self.clf_factory(**best_params)
        # Train the classifier on the full training data
        self.clf.fit(X, y)
```

which means we train the best model on the same data X y that the model surely has seen during the inner phase of grid search

You're absolutely right to be confused about this, as the distinction between the training, validation, and test sets can be tricky in the context of nested cross-validation. Let's break it down and clarify what happens during each stage.

# Answer

### The Key Idea: Data Splits in Nested Cross-Validation
In **nested cross-validation**, the goal is to estimate model performance while **tuning hyperparameters** and then **evaluating the modelâ€™s generalization ability**. To do this properly, the data is divided multiple times across two levels of cross-validation, and hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Outer Cross-Validation Loop**:
   - The data is split into **training** and **test** sets for each fold. This test set is never used for hyperparameter tuning; it is only used to evaluate the final model after tuning.
   - In this stage, the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated on the outer test set, which mimics a real-world "test" scenario where the model should generalize to unseen data.

2. **Inner Cross-Validation Loop (Grid Search)**:
   - The **training set** from the outer loop is split further into smaller **training** and **validation** sets.
   - The inner cross-validation (k-fold) is used to find the best hyperparameters by training on the inner training folds and validating on the inner validation folds.
   - The best hyperparameters found from this inner loop are used to train a final model on the outer training set.

### Now, to clarify your confusion:

- After the **inner grid search** (the inner cross-validation loop), when the best hyperparameters are found, the classifier is instantiated with these parameters and **trained on the outer training set** (i.e., `X`, `y` in `GridSearch.fit()`).
  
- **Why is this okay?** Because the model has never seen the outer test set, and this outer test set is the one that matters for final evaluation. The inner validation sets were used only for tuning hyperparameters, not for the final evaluation. Therefore, training on the entire outer training set after tuning does not "leak" any information into the final test set.

### The Validation Set:
- **In the inner loop** (during grid search), each fold has its own **validation set**, which is used to assess the performance of the model with different hyperparameters. This is where the validation happens.
- **In the outer loop**, after hyperparameter tuning, the final model (with the best parameters) is trained on the full outer training set and evaluated on the outer test set. This test set acts as the **final validation set**, giving an unbiased estimate of the model's generalization.

### Visualization of Nested Cross-Validation:

```
Outer Cross-Validation (e.g., 5-fold)
  â”œâ”€â”€ Outer Training Set (used for grid search)
  |     â”œâ”€â”€ Inner Cross-Validation (grid search on the outer training set)
  |     |     â”œâ”€â”€ Inner Training Set
  |     |     â”œâ”€â”€ Inner Validation Set (used for hyperparameter tuning)
  |     â””â”€â”€ Best Hyperparameters are found and used to train the model on the full outer training set
  â””â”€â”€ Outer Test Set (used only for evaluating the final model)
```

### To Summarize:
- **Inner validation** happens during grid search, which is part of the inner cross-validation loop. Itâ€™s used to determine the best hyperparameters.
- After tuning, the best hyperparameters are used to train the model on the **outer training set** (which includes the inner validation data). But this trained model is then evaluated on the **outer test set**, which was never involved in the tuning process, ensuring an unbiased final evaluation.

This structure prevents "data leakage" and provides a more reliable measure of model performance on unseen data.
